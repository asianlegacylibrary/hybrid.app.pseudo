### Folios / Pages

- there is PECHA and WESTERN format to check
- can be that a text is split into multiple files so there may need to be a concatenation
- check that folios are in sequence and not missing any of them
- things like 089B to 001A can mean that text wasn’t split and should be
- also, how a text starts, with a title page and then the subsequent ‘first page’
- misplaced folio marker, like the @ sign in the middle of a line
- single line folios, should be more lines
